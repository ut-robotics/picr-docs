= Mechanics checklist

== General

=== All sketches have to be fully defined

xref:basketball-robot-guide/mechanics/design.adoc#_fully_defined_sketch[Fully defined sketch in Mechanics Design > Sketches]

=== Milled parts have to be modeled based on the material used for milling

Do not use nominal material measurements. +
For example, do not model parts as if they are milled from 5mm thick material
when the material is actually 4,8mm.

=== Milled parts should be modeled so they're millable from one side

Milled parts should be modeled so their features are millable from one side. +
Milling from two sides is a time-consuming process.

=== Check interference between parts

Use the Interference tool to check if any parts are misaligned. +
The volume between two interfering parts will be shown. +
If you have models that have many internal parts, e.g. computer or camera,
use only their frames for checking interference.

=== Make robot parts affixable without adhesives or pressure fit

In almost all cases, parts should be affixed using bolts.

=== Make bolts and parts accessable

Bolts used for affixing parts to the chassis should be accessable. +
When designing parts that are attached together, you should think about how
the components are positioned and assembled together. +
"_How many parts do I need to disassemble to access this specific component?_" +
"_Would this new part cover up a bolt that I would constantly need to access?_" 


=== Make bolt holes and their responses correctly dimensioned

xref:basketball-robot-guide/mechanics/design.adoc#_fasteners[Fasterners in Mechanics Design]

When a bolt goes through multiple parts, only the last part should have a
threaded hole. +
Having the correct responses modeled will be a good reference when making
threaded holes for the physical parts.


=== Make inside corners with dogbones

xref:basketball-robot-guide/mechanics/design.adoc#_inside_sharp_corners[Inside sharp corners in Mechanics Design]

When milling, sharp inside corners are impossible to be milled due to the
radius of the tool. This will cause the corners to be rounded, and this can
cause unplanned changes to the model. +
Use dogbones when something needs to properly fit into a rectangular hole. +
If a hole is used for passing cables or wires through, dogbones are not needed
and only rounded corners can be used.


=== Add models of components to the robot model

Having models of all main components, i.e. voltage regulator, mainboard,
switches, batteries, etc., will give you a better visual of how everything will
fit inside. +
These models should also have features such as mounting holes and positions of
the cables running from the component.


=== Verify that the models you are using for the robot have same dimensions in real life

Verify the actual dimensions of the models you are using in your robot. +
Verify the dimensions of mounting holes on the components.


=== Think about cables and wiring

Cables and wiring take up some space, consider their path when they route
between components. +
Cable plugs take up a lot of space, leave room for them to be pluggable-
unpluggable.


=== Make sure that batteries don't move horizontally

The robots experience lots of horizontal forces. +
Batteries should be attached-mounted so they have limited horizontal movement.


=== Round out sharp outside corners

The robot will be safer to handle if there aren't any sharp corners protruding
from the robot.

== Camera

xref:basketball-robot-guide/mechanics/design.adoc#_camera[Camera in Mechanics Design]

=== Center the RGB sensor of the camera to the center of the thrower

Having the camera's RGB sensor centered on the thrower will make it easier to
program and handle throwing balls.

=== Add an FOV pyramid of the RGB sensor to the model

The cone will show which parts of the robot might possibly interfere with the
view of the camera.

== Thrower

=== Mount thrower motor so the wires are outside of the path of travel

The thrower motor should be mounted so the wires of the motors don't go inside,
toward the ramp. +
The wires should exit the thrower as far away as possible from the path the ball
will travel through the thrower.


=== Add support for thrower ramp

The thrower ramps can bend outward when the ball goes through the thrower. +
Add supporting pieces, i.e. spacers, to minimize the movement of the ramps.

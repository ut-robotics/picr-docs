== Mainboard

=== Functionality

* Closed loop speed control of 3 brushless DC motors.
** Designed for https://www.pololu.com/category/116/37d-metal-gearmotors[Pololu 37D Metal Gearmotors]
with quadrature encoders.
** Motor driver current limited to 1.94 A.
** Motor driver supply voltage up to around 16.8V (maximum voltage of 4S LiPo batteries).
Limited by ceramic capacitors that are rated  to 25 V.
* Reverse voltage protection MOSFET on the motor driver supply side.
* Two 5 V small hobby servo outputs with 50 Hz PWM signals.
* One BLDC ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) signal output using DShot protocol at 150 kb/s.
* Reverse voltage protected motor power output for thrower ESC.
* Isolation between microcontroller and motor drivers.
* STM32G441KBT6 microcontroller.
** Powered through USB connector.
* Micro-USB socket for communicating with a computer over virtual COM port.
* Two ball detector inputs.
* 10-pin SWD (Serial Wire Debug) connector.
* One UART interface with solderable pads.
* Two M2 mounting holes.

==== Sending commands to mainboard

Struct in firmware

[source,c,tabsize=2]
----
typedef struct __attribute__((packed)) Command {
  int16_t speed1;
  int16_t speed2;
  int16_t speed3;
  uint16_t throwerSpeed;
  uint16_t servo1;
  uint16_t servo2;
  uint8_t disableFailsafe;  // 1 to disable failsafe, anything else to enable
  uint16_t delimiter;
} Command;

Using with python's link:https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html[struct library]

[source,python,tabsize=4]
----
disable_failsafe = 0

struct.pack('<hhhHHHBH', speed1, speed2, speed3, thrower_speed, servo1, servo2, disable_failsafe, 0xAAAA)

actual_speed1, actual_speed2, actual_speed3, motor1_position, motor2_position, motor3_position, sensors,  feedback_delimiter = struct.unpack('<hhhhhhBH', received_data)
----

==== Thrower speeds

Thrower speeds are sent to thrower motor controller using
https://dmrlawson.co.uk/index.php/2017/12/04/dshot-in-the-dark/[DShot protocol].
Speed values are between 48 - 2047 for 0 to 100% speed.

==== Servo values

Servo signal (PWM) frequency is 50 Hz (period 20 ms or 20000 µs).
Values correspond to pulse width in µs.
Value of 1000 changes pulse width to 1 ms (1000 µs).
Value of 2000 changes pulse width to 2 ms (2000 µs).
